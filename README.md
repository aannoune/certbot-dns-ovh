# Certbot plugin for OVH DNS
Certbot hook scripts that allow to respond to DNS-01 challenges from _Let's Encrypt_ by updating the DNS zone in an OVH account.

Available on NPM: `npm i certbot-dns-ovh`

# Why and when you might need this
There are several use cases for DNS challenge with **Certbot**. For example, when the server or machine that needs a
certificate is not directly accessible from the internet; this way, you can secure machines and services in your
internal network or company domain, even behind a firewall or VPN. Another example for this is to automatically deploy certificates to servers that for any reason cannot perform their challenges, like CDNs or other servers that for any reason cannot run **Certbot**. In this case you would need more automation to deliver the certificates securely to those hosts, but it's not the scope of this project.

## Prerequisites
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) â‰¥ 6.
- [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org).

## Usage
0. Install via NPM: `certbot-dns-ovh`. Otherwise, you can download or clone this repo, and then from a terminal enter the directory: `cd certbot-dns-ovh` and run `npm install`.

1. Get an _App Key_ and _App Secret_ from OVH by registering a new app at this URL:
[OVH Developers: Create App](https://eu.api.ovh.com/createApp/)
(see more details here: [First Steps with the API - OVH](https://api.ovh.com/g934.first_step_with_api)).

2. Obtain a _Consumer Key_ (aka Authentication Token) by running the included script in a terminal:  
`node bin/authorize.js --endpoint=ovh-eu --app_key=yourappkey --app_secret=yourappsecret`  
by replacing "yourappkey" and "yourappsecret" with the values you received in the previous step, and optionally using a
different endpoint than "ovh-eu".

3. You will get a response with an URL:  
`{ validationUrl: 'https://eu.api.ovh.com/auth/?credentialToken=jed...',
  consumerKey: '69X...',
  state: 'pendingValidation' }`  
Visit the `validationUrl` and login with the account with the DNS zone to be updated, and select a suitable _Valitidy_
(it would make sense to use Unlimited, unless for testing purposes). The `consumerKey` that you received with the
`validationURL` will now be authorized to access your account.

4. Copy the file `.env.example` to `.env`, and fill the values that you received from OVH.
As endpoint, the default value is `ovh-eu`.

5. Now you're ready to setup **Certbot**! You can run the following command:  
`sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns --manual-auth-hook '/path/to/certbot-dns-ovh/bin/create-record.js' --manual-cleanup-hook '/path/to/certbot-dns-ovh/bin/delete-record.js' -d www.example.com`.  
This command will wait for up to 60 seconds (or more if you raise the value `DNS_TIMEOUT` in your `.env` file).

6. If everything goes right, you will get a certificate! It will be saved at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/www.example.com/fullchain.pem`.
You can add it your webserver configuration or copy to another server if you need to.

7. Now, automate! You can add the line `@weekly certbot renew --quiet` to your crontab, for example: `sudo crontab -e`.
If you're using a webserver like Nginx, this line could be `@weekly certbot renew --quiet && systemctl restart nginx.service`.

**NB**: the `certbot renew` command uses the same options as the `certbot certonly` command, so please do not move or delete
the `ovh-certbot-dns` directory.
